# archlinux-alias
Contains useful Arch Linux Aliases and shortcuts. 

Additionaly I added some useful bashrc commands, to improve the command line workflow.

Use the alias "help-alias" to get an overview of all useful alias commands

```bash
git clone https://github.com/normannator/archlinux-alias.git && cd archlinux-alias/ && cat alias.sh >> ~/.bashrc
```
